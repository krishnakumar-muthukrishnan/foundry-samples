DESCRIPTION:
    This sample demonstrates how to use agent operations with the 
    OpenAPI tool from the Azure Agents service using a synchronous client.
    To learn more about OpenAPI specs, visit https://learn.microsoft.com/openapi

USAGE:
    python openapi.py

    Before running the sample:

    pip install azure-ai-agents azure-identity jsonref

    Set these environment variables with your own values:
    1) PROJECT_ENDPOINT - the Azure AI Agents endpoint.
    2) MODEL - The deployment name of the AI model, as found under the "Name" column in
       the "Models + endpoints" tab in your Azure AI Foundry project.
